## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to deploy a React app using GitHub Pages.

### Continued development

to improve my skills in React and Tailwind CSS. I also want to learn more about state management in React, especially using libraries like Redux or Context API.
I plan to work on more projects that involve complex state management and data fetching to solidify my understanding of these concepts.
I also want to explore more advanced CSS techniques and frameworks to enhance my styling skills.
I want to learn more about accessibility in web development and how to make my projects more inclusive for all users. I plan to read more about ARIA roles and best practices for accessible design.
